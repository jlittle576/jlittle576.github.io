<h2>
Getting Up and Running
</h2><br />
<p>
The first part in the <a href="getting_started_with_python.html">Getting Started with Python</a> series,
this article is intended to convince you that Python is (probably) the single best
programming language for you, let you know which version to pick, and how to get up and
running.
</p>
<p>
As with the other articles in the series, <a href="./learning_python.html">Learning Python</a> and <a href=
"./using_an_ide.html">Using an IDE</a>, it is targeted at beginners who want to learn a general purpose
programming for personal use and/or to supplement their professional skillsets.

<h3>
Simple yet Effective
</h3><br />
<p>
Python has minimal syntax. It look more like English than any other popular language.
Despite its simplicity, a line of Python can be highly efficient, often accomplishing
what would take multiple lines in "low(er)-level" languages like Java or C++. These two
qualities make it both quick to learn, and quick to code. Quick to code means both that
its take less typing to accomplish a task, and that it tends to take much less debugging
than programs with stricter rules.
</p>
<h3>
Strong, and Getting Stronger
</h3><br />
<p>
Python is very strong AND is still on the rise. The two most popular languages that closely compare
to Python are Perl and Ruby, checkout this <a href=
"http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%22python%20programming%22%2C%20%22perl%20programming%22%2C%20%22ruby%20programming%22&amp;cmpt=q">
google trends comparison of the 3</a>

<h3>
Modules, modules, modules
</h3><br />
<p>
Python has a huge community and lots of great modules, and it's popularity is not focused
on a specific is niche, it has strongholds in web-development, game development, and
scientific/engineering community. In the field of Computer Aided Engineering, Python APIs() are
nearly ubiquitous. It has great cross-platform capabilities and GUI libraries. There are
several very popular libraries written in other language that have great Python
"bindings".
</p>
<h3>
Press the easy button
</h3><br />
<p>
The other benefit Python's popularity is the sheer amount of material available on line.
One invaluable resource is <a href=
"http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> (you don't have to actually go there, just
google your question, SO posts will typically be the 1st results). Questions are posted
and responses are 'voted up'; the top response is often an great example with an in-depth
explanation. With 300k+ Python posts, chances are you're quest already has a great answer
posted. There is also an abundance of larger tutorials and walkthroughs all over the web
for about anything you'll be interested in.
</p><br />
<h2>
Why not to pick Python
</h2><br />
<p>
While Python has the clear advantage as a general purpose light/moderate programming
language, its not the be-all-end-all of programming.
</p>
<p>
If you are purely interested in web development, the best starting place is HTML/CSS basics, then 
JavaScript (not related to Java). There is a very popular <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting">server side scripting</a>
python module called django, but most beginners probably want to do <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting">client side scripting</a>, where
JavaScript is the de-facto standard.
</p>
<p>
For Android development, Java. Google has a very nice 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a> development package
(based on IntelliJ, like PyCharm) to get you started.
</p>
<h3>
"Scripting" Languages vs "Serious" Languages
</h3><br />
<p>
Java is the dominate language in a lot professional software development right now, with
C++ still being dominant in the scientific/engineering community for heavy computational
work. Java and C++ are what am amateur like me would call 'serious' programming
languages, compared to Python they will have steeper learning curves, and require more
typing to achieve the same results. But a 1000 lines of code runs and in microseconds
instead of milliseconds, and all that extra code and syntax, a.k.a. verbosity, allows
complex programs to be more robust, so they are better suited for large software
development. Unless your goals are to get a software development postion (sans degree) 
the advantages will likely be lost on the "light" software deveoper.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of degrees, my alma mater now teaches Python as a introductory language, because Python
can supports the advanced constructs found in Java C++, yet is easier to learn, it is a very effienct way
to teach programming concepts. Students later transition to other languages with very brief or no in-class
ramp up time.

<a name="What version of Python?"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;color:#00AAFF;'>What
version of Python?</span></a><a href="#top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to top</a>
</h2><br />
<p>
2.7
</p>
<p>
Python 3 is on a separate development track than 2, e.g. Python 2.7 is newer than 3.1.
2.7 is on long-term support and won't be superseded by another Python 2 version.
</p>
<p>
Form what I read, Python 3 is a robust, capable, improved language. Python 2.7 is no
longer being actively improved (thought many 3rd party 2.7 libraries are) but it still
has significant advantages advantage in terms of maturity and popularity, and it look
like it'll be that way for awhile.
</p>
<p>
2.7 has been around long enough to have largely replace 2.6 and lower, though versions as
low 2.4 are not dramatically different than 2.7, so if your need to switch over for a
specific reason your 2.7 knowledge will be largely transferable.
</p>
<p>
Minor releases, e.g. 2.7.6 are patch releases. Unless you have a specific reason, get the
latest, 2.7.6 at time of writing.
