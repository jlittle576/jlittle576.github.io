          Qt - a C++ cross-platform graphics library<br />
          Qt Designer - A program for graphically laying out a GUI, saves to UI file, not language
          specific<br />
          PyQt - a Python "binding" of Qt which allow use of Qt amd UI files using only
          Python<br />

        <h3>
          1) Setup
        </h3><br />
        <p>
          You have to have Python, the pyQt library, and the Qt Designer program. You *don't* need
          to separately install Qt, which is a ~3gb library.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Get UI Designer (by Installing <a href=
          "http://portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython2.7.6.1/">PortablePython 2.7</a>)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Currently Qt has rolled QtDesigner into a larger package, QtCreator, which I don't know
          much about. Portable Python includes a portable version of QtDesigner which is what I've
          always used. AS with many programs, I install this to my [dropbox]/code/installations/...
          folder so I always have access to a python installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you get it installed, the executable for QtDesigner will be in the folder you
          installed PortablePytohn to. You can create a shortcut to it on your desktop, and/or you
          can associate it with UI files by using Open With... on any UI file.<br />
          <img src="./pyqt_quickstart/install_dir.png" alt="" />
        </p>
        <h3>
          Get pyQt
        </h3><br />
        <p>
          Now the PortablePython installation includes Python 2.7 and PyQt, along with many other
          libraries, preinstalled, so you can also use it for code execution. If you are not using
          an IDE, this means <a href="">calling the executable</a> located at [install
          dir]/App/python.exe. If you are <a href="">using an IDE</a> (recommended), this means
          doing <a href="">interpreter configuration</a> for the same path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, you can do a standard Python 2.7 install then install the PyQt library from the
          <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt">Unofficial Windows Binaries for
          Python Extension Packages</a>, pick the one for Python2.7 and either 32-bit or 64-bit
          according to which version of Python you have installed.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2) Download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkgnvcc5ap94t2n/basic.ui">basic.ui</a> and
          save it your project folder
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is a UI file created by UI designer with just 2 buttons and a text window. It was
          easy to make this from scratch in the UI designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can open it in UI Designer and take a look. You can also play around with adding new
          elements, but don't save over it for now.<br />

        <h3>
          3) Create a new python file in the project directory
        </h3><br />
        <p>
          Paste the following boilerplate code for loading a UI file. This is a complete python
          script, e.g. it will run, but it doesn't do anything in the way of making the GUI
          elements do stuff<br />
        </p>
        <div class="codebox">
          <pre>import sys from PyQt4 import QtGui, uic 
class MyWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow): 
	def __init__(self): 
		super(MyWindow, self).__init__()
		uic.loadUi('basic.ui', self) self.show()
app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MyWindow()
sys.exit(app.exec_())</pre>
        </div><br />
        <p>
          Like much of my boilerplate code, it was copied directly from <a href=
          "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2398800/linking-a-qtdesigner-ui-file-to-python-pyqt">a
          stackoverflow post</a>, thanks kermit666! You can reuse this code at the start of any
          pyQt project, just change the name of the UI file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running this should display basic.ui much like it did in UI Designer
        </p>
      </div>
