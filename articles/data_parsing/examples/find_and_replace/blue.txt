about a little guy that lives in a blue world 
and all day and all night and everything he sees 
is just blue like him inside and outside 
blue his house with a blue little window 
and a blue corvette 
and everything is blue for him and hisself 
and everybody around 
cos he ain't got nobody to listen to

i have a blue house with a blue window. 
blue is the colour of all that i wear. 
blue are the streets and all the trees are blue.
