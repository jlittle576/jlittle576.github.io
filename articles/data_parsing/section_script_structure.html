<h3><br>Looping Strategy</h3>
<h4><br>Synchronous Loop<br></h4>
<p>Despite being for simple tasks only, this quick method pack a punch.
There is a single loop which performs a line read and a line write with no holistic intermediate data storage</p>
<h4>Discrete Loops<br></h4>
<p>At somepoint the task outgrows the synchronous strategy and we implement a multi-state 'digestion' of the date.
Each loops output is the next loops input. The first is ususally a file readn and the last a file write, and none one or many intermediate stages.
Loops cost runtime, so they should be used frivolously. Also <b>simpler</b> is <b>best</b>, but doing to much in a loop leads to <b>complicated</b> code which can be <b>good</b>,
but adding a loop typically converts it to <b>complex</b> code which is <b>better</b>. This is a cornerstone concept of python, see  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a> </p>
