<p>Below is a very simple Synchrounous File Loop:
<br>   1) Input/Outpit file are opened
<br>   2) Read/Operate/Write/Repeat
<br>   3) Files are closed
</p>

<div class="titlebar" style="height:50px;width:650px;">
<h2>find_and_replace.py</h2>
<p>Create a copy of a file replacing 'blue' with 'brown'</p>
</div>
<iframe seamless src='./examples/find_and_replace/find_and_replace.html' frameborder=1 width=656px height=350px></iframe>

<br><br><p>Often python <ic>for</ic> loops have the form <ic>for item in iterable</ic>
The iterable can be anythign that is array-like, or in other words,
be pretty much anything that you would want to loop through,
and the 'item' is the incrementing item from the array. For files,
it gives one line of text at a time. Note that the use of the name 'line' is 
common, but arbitrary.<p>
