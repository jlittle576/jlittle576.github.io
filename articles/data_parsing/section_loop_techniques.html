<h3><br>Internal Loop Methods</h3>
<p>Whithin the loop mutiple action may be taken to condition data</p>
<h4>Line Decompositon (Strings to Data)<br></h4>
<p>Lines(stings) are converted into data. In basics cases, using sting.split(), in more advanced, using regular expression patterns</p>
<h4>Line Reconstruction (Data to Strings)<br></h4>
<p>Data is reconstited into strings for output using some form of formatted sting print (SPRINTF)
<h4>Conditional behaviors<br></h4>
<p>The iteration action depends on some condition. The conition can only be based on the current line, of it can be based on flags which have discret set/unset conditions (finite state machine)</p>
<h4>Cacheing/Nested Iteration<br></h4>
<p>A certain amound of data, spanning multiple indexes/lines, is read into a varaible for storage, then treated like a single piece of data.</p>
