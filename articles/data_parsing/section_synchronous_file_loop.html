<h2>Synchronous File Loop (SFL)</h2>
<br>
<p>As seen in the <a>Find &amp; Replace</a>
example, a synchronous file loop loops through input and output file
(or other data source) simultaneously.</p>
<div class="titlebar" style="height: 50px; width: 750px;">
<h3> Example: Find &amp; Replace <a id="displayText" href="javascript:load('example_basic_visualize');"> + Expand</a></h3>
<p> Process a file, replacing certain text strings </p>
</div>
<div id="example_basic_"></div>
<br>
<p>SFL's capabilities exten quite a bit beyond the ability to do
find and replace. Building up on top of it, we can create a class
sutiable for takes which consists primarily of takeing a line of text
apart. It won't take long to step beyond this scope (by storing
variables into structures and exploring more comples process
structures) but line de/reconstruction is a foundational set of
techniques in datafile parsing.</p>
