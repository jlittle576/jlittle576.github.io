The third part in the <a href="getting_started_with_python.html">Getting Started with Python</a> series,
this article is discusses the benefits of using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) almost exclusively
for both developing and executing code, recommends pyCharm, and discusses how to configure pyCharm.
</p>
<p>
As with the other articles in the series, <a href="./learning_python.html">Learning Python</a> and <a href=
"./using_an_ide.html">Using an IDE</a>, it is targeted at beginners who want to learn a general purpose
programming for personal use and/or to supplement their professional skillsets.

  Most IDE's will have the basic features below, which will be beneficial to programmers at
  any level:
</p>
<p>
  - Basic error identification<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;-e.g. using a variable not yet declared<br />
  - Automatic indenting<br />
  - Code completion<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;- works like google search auto-complete<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;- imported module attribute/methods<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;- internal variables and functions<br />
  - Code 'Structure' navigation<br />
  - 'Click to navigate to code' on code errors<br />
</p>
<p>
  Of course, if you start to get serious about programming, there are many other features
  you'll get into

  JetBrains pyCharm, that was easy!
</p>
<p>
  pyCharm is the best python IDE out there right now. A few years ago, this spot was held
  by a Java IDE called Eclipse with a Plugin Called pyDev. PyCharm pretty much better
  all-around in my opinion, as well as the community at large (<a href=
  "http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=pydev%2C%20pycharm">pyCharm vs pyDev Google
  Trends comparison</a>). pyCharm is used by professional software developers and amatures
  alike.

<h2>
  Prep
</h2><br />
<p>
  Go ahead an create a directory for your python code. I highly recommend coding out of a
  Dropbox directory. My code lives in a folder [dropbox]/code/projects and then
  subdirectories from there for different projects. I keep a subdirectory for
  examples/tutorials, like those from the <a href=
  "https://developers.google.com/edu/python">Google Python Class</a>
</p>
<p>
  You should also have Python installed at this point. Following my suggestion, that will
  be version <a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/">2.7.x</a> with
  default selections.
</p>
<h2>
  Installation
</h2><br />
<p>
  Download <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">pyCharm Community
  Edition</a>. The professional edition includes a lot of extra great features which you
  can research on JetBrains' site, and its a steal for only $100, but Community Edition is
  free and has all of the core Python functionality you need, especially as a beginner.
</p>
<p>
  Install pyCharm with defaults selections. I install to Dropbox and use the same
  installation from multiple computers. The executable is at [install
  dir]/bin/pyCharme.exe, and I just make separate shortcuts to that on each computer I use
  (the paths are different).
</p>
<h2>
  Configuration
</h2><br />
<p>
  You won't always see the two screens shown below. Don't worry, I'll include instructions
  for doing everything from the main GUI as well.<br />
  <br />
  On first startup you will see:<br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/pycharm_init_config.png" alt="" /><br />
  The defaults are fine, thought I personally like the Darcula theme a lot.
</p>
<p>
  The next screen will be shown whenever no project is open (such as after a fresh
  installation):<br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/welcome_screen.png" width=600 alt="" /><br />
  Pick 'Open Directory' and pick the folder you've created for your code. This will create
  a 'project' there. Until you manually close it, starting pyCharm will load up this
  'project' automatically, e.g. you will go straight to the main interface.
</p>
<h2>
  Linking to the Python Executable
</h2><br />
<p>
  At this point, we'll assume we're at the standard interface and go ahead and set-up
  configure the Python executable
</p>
<p>
  - Goto File -&gt; Settings<br />
  - From the list on the left, Expand 'Python Interpreter' -&gt; Select 'Python
  Interpreters'<br />
  - Click '+' (top right)<br />
</p>
<p>
  If installed at the default location, the context menu that appears should have a
  selection like C:/python27/python.exe<br />
</p>
<p>
  Otherwise pick 'Local...' and navigate to python.exe inside the desired Python
  installation<br />
</p>
<p>
  At this point you should be seeing something like:<br />
  <br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/pyCharm_interp_config.png" alt="" /><br />
</p>
<p>
  Click OK.
</p>
<h2>
  Main GUI - Run your first script
</h2><br />
<p>
  At this point you should be at the main GUI and have a project/directory opened where you
  want to keep your code. If you are at the main GUI, you have a project open. If its not
  at the location you want, go to File -&gt; Open Directory... If there no files in your
  project dir, the GUI will look something like:<br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/main_1.png" alt="" /><br />
  Mouse over the square in the bottom left and click 'Projects' to show the Projects
  pane<br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/main_5.png" alt="" /><br />
  Now the GUI should look like:<br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/main_2.png" alt="" /><br />
  - Right click on the main project folder ('sample_dir' in this case)<br />
  - New -&gt; Python file<br />
  - Name it 'hello'<br />
  - Enter into the file editor<br />
  <br />
</p>
<div class="codebox">
  <pre>print 'hello'</pre>
</div><br />
<br />
<img width=600 src="using_an_ide/main_3.png" alt="" /><br />
<p>
  - Go to Run -&gt; Run..<br />
  - Pick 'hello' from the small pop-up<br />
  - The Terminal should appear and show the output of the programs<br />
  <br />
  <img width=600 src="using_an_ide/main_4.png" alt="" /><br />
</p>
<p>
  Congrats, you're now a pyCharm user!
</p>
<h2>
  Tips
</h2><br />
<p>
  - Run -&gt; Run will always run the last script, use Run -&gt; Run.. to get the selection
  menu to run another script<br />
  - If you need to have files outside of a single large projects directory, multiple
  projects/directories can open at once<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- File -&gt; Open -&gt; Select Folder<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Select 'open in Current Window' and 'Add to Currently OPen
  Projects'<br />
  - As your scripts start to get longer, you'll want to start using the 'Structure' pane to
  quickly navigate between functions/classes/etc<br />
  - Set convenient Hotkeys for Run and Run... you will be pressing them a lot<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- File -&gt; Settings -&gt; (From list on left) Keymap<br />
