<h2>How I Got Into Programming</h2>
<br>
<p>
My degree is in Mechanical Engineering. It was tough choice over
Computer or Software Engineering. I would have like to do a combination
of the three, but basically this is frowned on and you don't get a real
degree if you do this (though I did queeze in a few classes from each).
</p>
<p>
I though that with my interests robotics was going to be the ticket,
but the organizaiton I would up getting sucked into was
 <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fsae&amp;tbm=isch">Formula
SAE</a>.
Basically, a few dedicated kids
design and build essentially a scaled sound f1 car from scratch with large degree of engineering freedom.
Not only did we have access to state of the art fabrication facilities,
essentially every high-end mechanical engineering software companies offered
free use of their products in exchange for a postcard sized sticker on our bodywork.

After a few years and few thousand hours experience in Solidworks, a <a>CAD</a> I set my sights on the



<br>
Basically,  I noticed 2 large annoyances (2 that I could fix anyway):
1) Too many mouse click/keystrokes to get from design A to design B.
2) Too many mouse clicks/keystrokes to get the model data from software A to software B.

Fortunately I found the cure all for anything you don't like about software, macro and scripting.



<p>Fortunately, after 3 years of that and I was proficient at a handful
of softwares,
particually the MDB program MSC.ADAMS, which as its turns out was quite
a rare/desirable skill for a college student, so I got involved in a
research
team doing Multi-Displinary Optimizaiton, which involed writing code in
MATLAB to glue multple types of commecial software, including Adams,
together into design optimzation loops. Further along the lines of
rare/desirabe the maker of the software &nbsp;approache me&nbsp;to
support it in the Greater Detroit Area, then a couple years later one
othe largers users approach me to develop Adams analysis processes at
the company.</p>

<p>Backing up a bit,&nbsp;I am and have always been interested in doing
things
better, specifically using computers to do things better. After
mastering&nbsp;the de-facto standard MBD software pretty earlier in my
carrer,&nbsp; the natural progression for me was
macros/API/customizaion.
&nbsp;I did this in Adams's proprietary View Command language. I had
learned C++ in school and adone a little with that, but after about a
year MSC I was staring to using View Command regularly, memores of C++
started to fade,&nbsp; and View Command became my solitary proramming
skill, despite exisitng entirely in the confines of Adams.</p><p>About this time, a friend of mine was creating
a space shooter game in Python and wanted me to help program some
physics. Python was comparable to MATLAB in simplicity and capability (via the SciPy libraries), and
worlds easier than C++ all around while still having support for programming constructs like object oriented programming.
Turns out it was used internally at MSC for utility development and
many CAE programs were beginning to adopt it as the API, so I was able
to find enough to projects keep my skill level progressing.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, around half of my work is in Python, and with
current trends of transitioning to Python as an API language it should
soon be more. I have a unique, valuable set of skills on the cusp of
their prime in my industry, and a very challenging and rewarding job
doing a mix of mechanical engineering and "light weight" programming. I
have had oppertunities to move officially into the field of software
development, and may at some point, but for now have a foot in both
worlds, with officially residing on the engineering side, is a great
place to be. </p>
<p><sup>1</sup>The entering class on the year i
graduated, 2011 was the
first to have programming as required cirriculum! Also, we store
millions of dollars of
model development&nbsp;in
texts files with no revision corntol!</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Take "mastered" with a grain of
salt, I simply mean
beaing able produce
arbitrary model functionality and output within reasonable limits; the
broader art of using analysis software to reach
accurate meaningful conclusions is another topic all together
