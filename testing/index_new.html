          Hi, my name is Joseph Little. I'm an automotive/mechanical engineer/CAE analyst/software
          customizer/process developer, or something like that. Welcome to my site, see below for
          an in-depth ramblings about myself, or for my projects or articles use the navigation on
          the left.
        </p>

          If you are here for my XML viewer, its called Blacklight, link on the left.

        <br />
        <p>
          My degree is in Mechanical Engineering from Mississippi State University. In school I got
          into a lot of things. 3 years of building race-cars in the Formula SAE program provided
          an excellent introduction to the engineering design/build/test/improve cycle and got me
          started with Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), especially the mechanical system
          simulation software MSC.ADAMS. I published some materials on using ADAMS for the FSAE
          community then started working on a research team integrating ADAMS into their
          multi-disciplinary optimisation work. MSC hired me out of college to support ADAMS/Car in
          the Greater Detroit Area.
        </p>
        <p>
          ADAMS has a API in its propriety Adams View Command Language for automating tasks and GUI
          customization. With access to the resources at MSC, and a natural tendency to tinker, I
          was pretty soon churning out custom macros and dialog boxes to address high priority
          issues for key customers. Pretty soon I was really experienced in a language that was
          useless outside of a single program.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned and used some C in college and had done some basic automation projects and
          micro-controller programming. A friend asked me to help out with implementing some
          physics behaviour in a game he was making in Python, he said I'd pick it right up. Python
          was so much better than any of the other languages I had experience with, and the
          community was excellent. I started doing projects at home and work doing things I
          previously though were out of my grasp as an amateur programmer. Turns out, Python is
          very popular for CAE APIs and even Adams has some unofficial Python capabilities, so the
          skill has a lot of synergy with my professional skill set, as well as allowing my to work
          on personal projects at home. At my current position the Chrysler Tech Center, supporting
          integration of CAE into simulation driven vehicle design, Python continues to prove
          itself as an invaluable skill in the next generation of CAE innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've taken advantage of quite a few open source tools and advice from friends and
          mentors, so I started this page as a way to give back to the Python community, and help
          others interested in becoming self-taught python programmers.
