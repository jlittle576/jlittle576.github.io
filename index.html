<h2>About Me</h2>
<br>
<p>
Hi, my name is Joseph Little. I am Mechanical Engineer, specialized in the
field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_simulation">multi-body
dynamics </a> (MDB) simulation,  a sub-diciplines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering">Computer Aided Engineering</a> (CAE),
which involves
using physics simulation software to analyze and improve the design of mechanical systems such as <a href="http://www.mscsoftware.com/product/adamscar">vehicles</a> and <a href="http://www.lifemodeler.com/products/lifemod/">human musculoskeletal systems</a>

<br><br>
Being someone that had trouble deciding between Software and Mechanical Engineering, and having a tendency to tinker led to me delving deep in macro creation, software APIs, custom GUIs and eventually into standalone utility development. A large part of my job today is customizing and integrating CAE software to enable innovative CAE processes. 
<br><br>
As a whole this involves myrid assortment of proprietary and/or obtuse API and 'shell' languages. Luckily the industry is trending toward the adoption of Python for API use.
<br><br>
Python is for all intensive purposes the Genghis Khan of medium/high level program languages. As mentioned above, its stating to be widely supported as an API language, also its easy to learn and type yet supports powerful programming paradigms; it has lots of great modules and a very large helpful user community. 
<br><br>
As you can likely tell, I'm a Python fan. This sites is home to some of my personal project and article on scripting and programming. At the moment, its ab it sparse and almost all Python related, though I do have some other topics are in the pipeline, so stay tuned.
<br><br>
Thanks for stopping by!<br>
Joe
