<h2>About Me</h2>
<br>
<p>
Hi, my name is Joseph Little. I am Mechanical Engineer, specialized in the
field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_simulation">multi-body
dynamics </a> (MDB) simulation,  a sub-diciplines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_engineering">Computer Aided Engineering</a> (CAE),
which involves
using physics simulation software to analyze and improve the design of mechanical systems such as <a href="http://www.mscsoftware.com/product/adamscar">vehicles</a> and <a href="http://www.lifemodeler.com/products/lifemod/">human musculoskeletal systems</a>

<br><br>
Being someone that had trouble deciding between Software and Mechanical Engineering, 
I was happy to find there's lots of opportunity and demand for custom code development
within the CAE industry. Software packages often have APIs, allow for macro creation and custom GUIs. 
There's also lots of opportunity for standalone utility development. A large part of my job today doing just that to enable innovative CAE processes. 
<br><br>
Of course there is a downside, a myriad of proprietary and/or obtuse API languages and development tools,
often with limited help available,
and limited support from managerial capacity who's wary of mechanical engineers developing code (often for good reason), just to name a few.
<br><br>
Luckily the industry is trending toward the adoption of Python for API use and many general programming tasks. Python is for all intensive purposes the Genghis Khan of medium/high level program languages. Its easy to learn and type yet supports powerful programming paradigms, has lots of great modules and a very large, helpful user community. 
<br><br>
As you can likely tell, I'm a Python fan. This sites is home to some of my personal project and article on scripting and programming. At the moment, its a bit sparse and almost all Python related, though I do have some other topics are in the pipeline, so stay tuned.
<br><br>
Thanks for stopping by!<br>
Joe
